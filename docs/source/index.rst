============

This repository contains a collection of meta functions useful for Gaussian Splatting, or
neural rendering in general. It is

* **Unified C++/CUDA interface**: Can be used in either C++ or CUDA code.
* **Header-only**: No need to compile and link against this library. Simply copy the headers to your project.
* **Fully tested**: All functions are thoroughly tested with unit tests.

It will be used as the backend for the `gsplat <https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat>`_ project.
